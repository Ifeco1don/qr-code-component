# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

This is a solution to the QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal of the challenge was to build a simple and responsive card component that displays a QR code, along with some text instructions. This project helped me practice writing clean HTML, applying consistent styling with CSS, and building layouts using a mobile-first approach.

## My process

I began by setting up the project with a clean folder structure and linking my HTML and CSS files. I structured the component using semantic HTML, then applied mobile-first styles using CSS. Flexbox was used to center the card on the page, and I styled the component with padding, rounded corners, and shadows to match the design. After testing responsiveness, I pushed the project to GitHub and deployed it using Github pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this challenge helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Writing clean and semantic HTML structure
- Styling components using CSS and Flexbox
- Applying a mobile-first approach to build responsive layouts
- Centering elements both vertically and horizontally
- Structuring a simple project and deploying it online

### Continued development

As I continue learning frontend development, I plan to focus more on:

- Improving layout skills using CSS Grid and advanced Flexbox techniques
- Deepening my understanding of responsive design and accessibility
- Writing cleaner, more reusable CSS
- Getting more comfortable with design tools like Figma for better developer handoffs
- Exploring more interactive components using JavaScript in future projects
